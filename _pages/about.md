I am a PhD student in the Artificial Intelligence group at the Hasso Plattner Institute, supervised by Prof. Gerard de Melo. My research centers on LLMs' safety, with a particular focus on developing novel methods to mitigate hallucinated text generation—spanning the stages of pretraining, alignment, and inference. Beyond this, I am also interested in topics such as interpretability and reasoning. 

I received both my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees from Tel Aviv University, where I pursued similar research topics under the supervision of Prof. Amir Globerson.

Industry Positions

In addition, I gained experience through several internship and student positions within the language research groups at IBM and Microsoft. During this time, I worked on topics such as instruction tuning, tool-use training, RAG, and in-context learning.
